This is a javascript project. This clock project uses a date now function to create different variables that render to the ui. I used the date now function to extract values such as getDate, 
getMinutes, getHours and many more. I did that to create an interesting user experience but also to offer valuable data to the user, such as minutes and hours in real time.
I hope you will find this project meaningful and also educational.
